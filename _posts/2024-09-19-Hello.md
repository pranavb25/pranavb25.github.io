I have been wanting to:
* Buy my name's .com domain
* Execute a basic web dev project
* Write and document my projects (and maybe thoughts?)

Clubbing all this, pranavbudhiraja.com is now live!

It's a basic enough build, but is exactly what I wanted:

1. **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**: Perfect for serving a simple static website such as this. 
2. **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)**: Seems to do the job for now. Still learning what all I can do with it.
3. **[Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)**: Just the right mix of minimal and functional.

That's about it! I plan to mostly post about side projects or random thoughts at the intersection of tech and business.
